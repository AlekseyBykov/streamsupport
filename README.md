# streamsupport

![](art/streamsupport-sf.png)

streamsupport is a backport of the Java 8 java.util.function (functional interfaces) and java.util.stream (streams)
API for Android and users of Java 6 or 7 supplemented with selected additions from java.util.concurrent which didn't
exist back in Java 6.

Due to the lack of default interface methods and static interface methods in pre-Java 8 the API had to be slightly
adjusted in these areas but still covers the full functionality scope of Java 8. In detail, static and default
interface methods have been moved to companion classes in the same package that bear the identical name as the
interface but with an "s" appended (e.g. Comparator -> Comparators).

For ease of use, the default methods for most of the functional interfaces were NOT retained as abstract methods
in the redefined interfaces (keeping them single method interfaces) - the missing default (and static) methods can
always be found in the corresponding companion class.
